FaB Deck Builder
Created by David Owens @ Owens Satisfactory Cards (satifsactorycards.com).

Currently, there are two ways to import a deck:
  1. JSON output from FaB DB
  2. JSON output from thepitchzone.com (thanks @Ever)

These follow the format defined here: https://gist.github.com/owensd/af086ac73d2b3692558ed804865fa319

  A lookup table for each of the card images. These are used to generate cards on-demand. This is done for a number of
  reasons:
    1. Managing the card images is a pain within TTS, so having these externally managed is much easier.
    2. These are hosted from the official card images, so any changes or updates will get picked up after clearing
       the cache.
    3. Spoiler season means that new cards can simply roll out automatically (assuming LSS can actually stick to their
       format, which they seem to have trouble doing).
    4. This makes the deck builder portable to any mod that wants to use it to import decks.

  Also note that not all cards have a URL as the format is assumed to be:
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/fabmaster/media/images/<PREFIX><CARDID>.width-450.png"

    PREFIX: is the three letter code for the set (e.g. WTR); this may also have the 'U-' unlimited prefix.
    CARDID: is the three digit numeric value on the card (e.g. 002)

  However, LSS seems to have trouble actually being consistent with this format, so only cards that need to use a
  different URL are listed here.
